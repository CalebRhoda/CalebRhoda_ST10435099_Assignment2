This is a Tomogatchi style application where you can take care of a virtual dog

When you start the app you can clicked on the button labelled 'Get Started' to continue to the main app

You will be greeted with a dog and three buttons with some values on the bottom labelled 'Hunger', 'Clean', and 'Happy'

These values will deplete over time

The buttons will increase those values accordingly

As an Example if you press the 'Feed' Button the Hunger value will increase etc
